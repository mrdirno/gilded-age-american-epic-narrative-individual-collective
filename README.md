### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a minor dockworker observes Silas's perfect memory in action and realizes its potential value—or danger.
- Draft a letter from Cornelius Leland to an unseen business partner, explaining his philosophy of 'physiological necessity' and his assessment of Silas Thorne.
- Create a monologue for Elara Vance, reflecting on the difference between the practical knowledge of the chandlery and the abstract knowledge of the ledger.
- Imagine a chapter from the perspective of the river itself, personified, watching the human drama on its banks with ancient indifference.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'River Ledger' that visualizes the flow of commodities (cotton, tobacco, machinery) through Silas's manifests, showing the network of plantations, buyers, and debts.
- Create a text-based simulation where the user must manage dock operations, balancing cargo, labor, and time, with Silas's memory as a key upgradable stat.

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10
